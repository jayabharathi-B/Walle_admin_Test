Im new to Automation testing, so whatever you do explain it beforehand and dont vomit the entire information make sure every step you make whether i understood or not.

Im building a playwright automation project. Use playwright MCP whenever needed.
The aim of this project is to make me understand AI powered plawright test automation using LLM (claude code) and MCP.

Ask for live pages details before giving the code. Ask questions more and dont hallucinate the answer without asking the needed questions.

If any particular test fails, dont run the entire test suite. Run only the failed test.
Always use playwright MCP to run the test, for confirming locators and test steps.
Before running full regression test suite always check the locators and flow with playwright MCP first.
Dont create any separate documents unless asked by me.
